## BTC Daily Candles Explained

Daily candles are the foundation of serious Bitcoin analysis.

Each day summarizes:

- Open
- High
- Low
- Close
- Volume

BTCalendar focuses on **Open and Close**, because they define direction.

## Why the daily close matters

Professional traders consider the daily close the most important price.

It shows:

- who won the day (buyers or sellers)
- momentum shifts
- breakouts
- support/resistance confirmation

## Example

If BTC opens at $40,000 and closes at $42,000:

Daily change = +5%

That’s a strong bullish day.

## Why BTCalendar simplifies it

Instead of chart clutter, you see:

- green days
- red days
- streaks

It’s faster to interpret visually.
