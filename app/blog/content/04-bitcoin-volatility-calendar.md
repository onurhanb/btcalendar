## Bitcoin Volatility Calendar

Bitcoin volatility is easier to understand visually than numerically.

Instead of reading percentages, a calendar shows clusters.

## Volatility clusters

You’ll often notice:

- calm months (small moves)
- explosive weeks
- panic selling streaks

Calendar layouts make these obvious.

## Why traders use this

It helps with:

- position sizing
- risk management
- regime detection

## Example

A month full of red days signals fear and potential capitulation.
