## Bitcoin Calendar Overview

Most traders watch Bitcoin price charts using candlesticks, indicators, and noisy overlays.  
BTCalendar takes a different approach.

Instead of complex charts, it visualizes **daily BTC/USDT candles inside a calendar layout**, allowing you to see patterns at a glance.

You can explore the live calendar on the [Home page](/).

## Why a calendar view?

Traditional charts answer short-term questions.

Calendars answer long-term behavior.

With a monthly grid you can instantly:

- spot green/red streaks
- detect volatile periods
- compare months side-by-side
- understand regime shifts

## What each day shows

Every cell represents one Binance daily candle:

- Open
- Close
- Percentage change
- Direction (green/red)

This removes noise and keeps only what matters.

## Who is this for?

- swing traders
- long-term investors
- data analysts
- BTC researchers
